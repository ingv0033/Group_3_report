    "\n",
    "1. This template serves as a guideline for structuring your miniproject report. You're supposed to follow the provided sections overall, but you're allowed to make changes or adjustments whenever it's appropriate for your particular project. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * For example, in each section provided below, you may use many cells instead of just one. \n",
    "\n",
    "    * You may also add subsections if you want. If necessary, you can also add or remove sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You should rename this notebook file to 'Group_xxx_report.ipynb' where 'xxx' is your group number in our [padlet] (https://padlet.com/luhua/dsv-f23-mini-project-group-formation-sgw8mxkajzhh0tli). This notebook should be submitted to Digital Exam in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make sure the data you use is available somewhere and accessible to the examiner and censor. You may upload your data together with this report to Digital Exam, or put it online and provide the URL to it in this report. It's your own responsibility to ensure the data accessibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Any text in '[ ]' throughout the template should be replaced by appropriate content that you're supposed to generate. Also remember to remove the pairs of '[' and ']' in the final report. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Give sufficient descriptive and explanative information by using Markdown cells and/or comments in Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Remove this cell in the final report.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If you have questions, please email to luhua@ruc.dk."
